# Abdul Derh's Portfolio

This repository is the source code for my portfolio, for demonstration purposes.

It features the following:

- Front-end using Svelte and TypeScript, packaged with WebPack (?)
- Styling with Tailwind or a derivative
- Mobile support and general front-end responsiveness
- Static output
- Deployed using Docker with GitHub CI/CD

Since this is meant to be a simple portfolio, I've decided not to use any back-end technologies Instead, the front-end is compiled with data in a static format. This portfolio doesn't really need back-end complexities, but I may add it later.
